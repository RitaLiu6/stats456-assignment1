The reason why I try to show the locations of F-1 race circuits is that I realize people with different cultural backgrounds tend to understand car race differently. As we can see, from the map, most circuits are located in Europe and North America. In terms of the theme, I choose to use dark blue for the points to make them stand out from the background and centred the title to make the graph look better.\n\n\n\n\n",

I’m interested in creating this graph because I’m curious how the rankings for different songs change over time: will popular songs continue to be popular or will they just be replaced by other songs. From the graph, we can see that for the top 10 songs in May 2021, there are different trends: some remained unchanged over the month but some of the songs are popular in the beginning but end up anonymous. Along the process, I’ve struggled with selecting the top 10 songs of each week but in the end, used “slice” to solve the problem.\n\n\n\n\n",
