> Above is the link for my shinny app and the responding github lin. This shinny app show CP plot of a lasso model that predicts the condition of the house. By dragging the bar or selecting variables from windwom on the left, we can input a new observation to draw a CP plot based on our lasso model. After a few try, I found that int_rate and annual_income seem to be important predictors!
